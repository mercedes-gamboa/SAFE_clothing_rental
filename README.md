## General info
This project is the beginning of a online clothing rental store. People are used to being able to shop clothes even when they'll use the items just once.
However, this project is about enableing a site where they can rent for a certain period of time and then return the clothes.

This project should help create a database of people who want to rent clothes for everyday situations, not only special occasions.

### Current stage

The plan is to build up this project so that it allows users to provide their own items for rental, exchange pieces with other users and subscribe for a month of regular rental.
However, at this point it provides a choice of items from the store owner's selection.
